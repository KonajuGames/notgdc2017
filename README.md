## #NotGDC 2017

A collection of short non-talks for the #NotGDC non-conference. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit something for this list. A non-talk can be anything game development related, for example:

- Some rough notes on a recent thought you've had;
- A more developer article about something that inspires you;
- Some sketches for a game idea you might work on; or
- A video or podcast ranting about fake gamedev and other amazing topics.

Share you submission on twitter with the #NotGDC hashtag and cc me into it ([@eigenbom](https://twitter.com/eigenbom)). Submissions are open while GDC is running.
