## #NotGDC 2017

Here is a collection of short non-talks for the [#NotGDC non-conference](https://twitter.com/eigenbom/status/835673367424315393). 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit something. A non-talk can be anything game development related, for example:

- Some rough notes on a recent thought you've had;
- A detailed article about a technical concept;
- Some sketches for a game idea you might work on; or
- A video or podcast ranting about fake gamedev and other amazing topics.

Share you submission on twitter with the #NotGDC hashtag and CC me ([@eigenbom](https://twitter.com/eigenbom)). Submissions are open while GDC is running.
